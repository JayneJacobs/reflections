When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Fill in your answer here

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I would want to be aware of any updates before syncing in case I did not want it to be permanent. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fogot to answer this. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   You can merge the changes locally and push to th remote repo
   

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would fork a repository and make changes then create a branch and merge the branch. 
     
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If I wanted to make a different release with different options I may want to add a feature to a branch. It may or may not merge back to the master but if it did the master could have additional differenes from the branch after a merge.
