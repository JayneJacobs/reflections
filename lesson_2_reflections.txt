Reflect: Commit Size

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
After every change use diff. After every logical change add the file to staging then use 

	diff --staged
	What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

 git branch "name"
 git checkout "name"
 git status

  They allow logical path to be traced for each commit. 
  home (master) reflections $ git remote
origin
git remote -v
